  <h2>Repositories Here and There</h2>

  <p>
    Earlier you learned about Git repositories and learned how to turn a project
    directory on your computer into a Git repository. In order to share your
    work with others, you can use GitHub as a central repository for code that a
    team of developers work on together.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to share code, you need a copy of your Git repository in a place
    where others can access it. That's what GitHub provides: a place to keep a
    shared repo. With a repo on GitHub, you can <strong>push</strong> your
    changes to it and <strong>pull</strong> down changes from others.
  </p>

  <p>
    The GitHub copy of the Git repository on your computer is called a
    <strong>remote</strong> repository; it is not on your computer, but on a
    server, "remote" and somewhere else. The Git respository on your computer is
    called your <strong>local</strong> respository. You'll need to manage both
    and keep them in sync.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other developers can always get the latest from your project by
    <strong>pulling</strong> your changes down from the remote (and onto their
    computer). This is how everyone can work on a project together without
    needing access to your computer, where your local copy is stored.

  <h3>Create a Remote Repository</h3>
  <p>
    You want to sync your <strong>local</strong> repository with the one on
    GitHub. We already have a local repo, so we'll need to create a GitHub repo.
  </p>

  <p class="tip">
    üíÅ You don't always start with a local repo. Sometimes you may start with a
    remote repo and have to make a local copy. It works both ways!
  </p>

  <p>
    First, we'll create a new <strong>remote</strong> repository on GitHub. It
    will be empty to start with.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Go to <a href="http://github.com " target="_blank">github.com</a>, log in,
      and click the "+" in the top right and then select "New repository".
    </li>
    <li>
      Give it a name that matches your local repository's name (<span
        class="code--inline"
        >hello-world</span
      >), and a short description.
    </li>
    <li>Make it public. This means it'll be listed on your public profile.</li>
    <li>
      Don't initialize with a README because we already have a file, locally,
      named "readme.txt". This is a helper option from GitHub if you hadn't
      already made it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Leave ".gitignore" and "license" set to "none". We won't use them for this
      tutorial.
    </li>
    <li>Click "Create repository"!</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="chal-background light-blue solid-box">
  <h2>README files, Licenses, and .gitignore</h2>
  <p>
    These are common files in open source projects. To make starting a new
    project easier, GitHub provides an option to create them automatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <strong>README</strong> file explains what the project is, how to use it,
    and often times, how to contribute (though sometimes there is an extra file,
    "CONTRIBUTING.md", for those details). The
    <span class="code--inline">.md</span> extension means it's a Markdown file.
    Markdown is a simple way to format text that looks great on GitHub.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <strong>.gitignore</strong> file contains a list of filenames that Git
    should <em>not</em> track; for instance, files with passwords!
  </p>
  <p>
    A <strong>license</strong> file describes the permitted use of the contents
    of the repo. It's optional to include one, but open source software authors
    often include it to define the fair use of their work. You can learn more
    about licenses in
    <a
      href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository"
      target="_blank"
      >GitHub's documentation</a
    >.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="chal-step blue-border border-box">
  <h3>Connect your Local to your Remote</h3>
  <p>
    You should be on the main page for your empty repository on GitHub. You
    should see a highlighted section labelled 'Quick Setup'. In that section,
    make sure the 'HTTPS' button is selected. Copy the URL shown; this is the
    address of your repository on GitHub's servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back in your terminal, and inside of the "hello-world" folder that you
    initialized as a Git repository in the earlier challenge, you want to tell
    Git to record the address of the remote version on GitHub's servers. It's
    possible to have multiple remotes, so each remote requires a name. The
    primary remote is typically named <span class="code--inline">origin</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To add a remote named "origin" to your repository, run this command and
    paste in the URL you just copied:
  </p>
  <code class="shell">git remote add origin your-URL-goes-here</code>

  <p>
    Your <strong>local</strong> repository now knows where your
    <strong>remote</strong> repository lives on GitHub's servers. Think of it as
    adding a name ("origin") and address (the URL of your repo) on speed dial.
    This lets your local repo communicate easily with the remote repo.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="chal-step blue-border border-box">
  <h3>Push Work to your Remote</h3>
  <p>
    Next you want to <strong>push</strong> (send) everything you've done locally
    to your remote repository on GitHub. This is something you'll do often, so
    that your remote repository is up to date and matches the state of your
    local repository.
  </p>

  <p>
    Git has a system for working on a project in an orderly way, allowing you to
    "branch" off and work on the project without interfering with what's already
    done. We'll learn more about that later.
  </p>

  <p>
    For now you just need to know that work in Git is always done on a
    <strong>branch</strong>. Branches contain commits. The first branch is named
    'main' by default. When you push (and later pull) from a project, you tell
    Git the <strong>branch name</strong> you want and the name of the
    <strong>remote</strong> that it lives on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your local Git repo already has a branch named main, and it has one commit
    on it that you made in an earlier challenge. We want that commit and the
    code it includes to be copied into the remote repo on GitHub.
  </p>

  <p>
    To create a branch named "main" in our remote repo on GitHub, we "push" our
    branch to the remote like this:
  </p>
  <code class="shell">git push origin main</code>

  <p class="tip">
    üíÅ In this case, "origin" is the name of the remote, and "main" is the name of
    the branch. The arguments to the push command are always in this order: git
    push remote-name branch-name.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now go to your remote repository on GitHub (in your browser) and refresh the
    page.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Wow!</strong> The work you did locally is now on GitHub! üéâ Congrats
    on your first public repository!
