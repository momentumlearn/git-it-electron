    <h2>Working Better, Together</h2>

    <p>The repository you've created so far is just on your computer, which is great for you, but you still need a way to share
        your code and work with others. That's what GitHub is for!</p>

    <p>GitHub allows people everywhere to upload what they're working on with Git, enabling them to
      work easily with others on the same project.</p>
      
    <p>Let's get set up to use GitHub for our work!</p>

    <h3>Create a GitHub Account</h3>

    <p>Visit <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account">sign up for a free account.</a> <strong>âœ‹ High
        five, welcome!</strong></p>
    
    <p>If you already have a GitHub account, you can use that for the next step.</p>
</div>

<div class="chal-step blue-border border-box">
    <h3>Add GitHub username to Git</h3>
    <p>Add the username for your GitHub account to your Git configuration. We'll do this just for the sake of Git-it; it makes it easier
        to verify the upcoming challenges. Save it exactly as you created it on GitHub and <strong>capitalize where
            capitalized</strong>.

    <p>For example, if your GitHub username was <strong>captainbarnacles</strong>, you would set it like this:</p>
    <code class="shell">git config --global user.username "captainbarnacles"</code>

    <p>You can double check what you have set in your Git config by typing:</p>
    <code>git config --global user.username</code>
</div>

<div class="chal-verify red-border border-box">
  <p>
    Click the 'Verify' button to confirm that you have successfully configured your GitHub username in Git.
  </p>
</div>

{{{ verify_button }}}

<div class="chal-tip grey-border border-box">
    <p>Make sure you type "<strong>user.username</strong>" above and not "user.name", which would override the name you
        set in the first challenge and leave you with no username property! If you found you did that, it's ok, just
        repeat the step in the first challenge to add your name and then complete the step above.</p>
</div>

<div class="chal-no-pass grey-border border-box">
    <h4>GitHub & Git config usernames do not match</h4>

    <p>A common error is not having your GitHub username match the case of the one you set with <code class="code--inline">git config</code>.
        For instance, 'JLord' isn't the same as 'jlord'</p>
    <p>To change your username set with Git, just run the same command you did earlier, but with the correct
        capitalization:</p>
    <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.username "yourusername"</code></p>
    <p>When you've made your updates, verify again!</p>
