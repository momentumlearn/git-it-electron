  <p>Practice managing multiple files in your Git repo.</p>

  <h2>Include or Exclude Changes to Compose Commits</h2>

  <p>
    As you learned earlier, a commit is a snapshot of changes made in a project.
    As you work, you make more and more commits. Commits become the project
    <strong>history</strong>, telling the story of the project's development.
  </p>

  <p>
    A commit can include related changes from a single file or from many files.
    It's up to you! Generally we want to make smaller, more frequent commits to
    keep our history organized and understandable. Doing that will take some
    practice, and it will get easier with experience.
  </p>

  <p>Let's practice managing changes in multiple files.</p>
</div>

<div class="chal-step blue-border border-box">
  <h3>Create a new file</h3>

  <p>
    Remember the command for creating a new file from the command line? Create a
    file named "demo.txt" in your repo.
  </p>
  <p><code class="shell">touch demo.txt</code></p>

  <p>
    Now open your code editor and put some content in that file. As the file
    extension (".txt") tells us, this is a plain text file, so you can put any
    text you want here.
  </p>

  <p class="tip">
    üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A file extension can be included at the end of a filename as a period (a
    "dot") followed by a few letters that indicate the content and purpose of
    the file. You may have seen image files with a ".png" or ".jpg" extension,
    ".doc" or ".docx" for Microsoft Word documents, or ".pdf" for PDF files.
    You'll see many more.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="chal-step blue-border border-box">
  <h3>Make changes to another file</h3>

  <p>
    Now delete the last line of "readme.txt", and save the file again in your
    text editor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Go back to your terminal and run
    <span class="code--inline">git status</span> to see what's changed. You
    should see the following:
  </p>
  <pre><code classname="code-block">
    On branch main
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
      modified:   <span class="code-red">readme.txt</span>

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
      <span class="code-red">demo.txt</span>

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Notice how your status gives you helpful suggestions for relevant commands.
    It's a good idea to read and consider these, though you don't have to do any
    of these suggestions now (or ever).
  </p>

  <p>
    For now, we will leave these changes unstaged while we take a closer look.
  </p>

  <div class="chal-step blue-border border-box">
    <h3>What's the diff?</h3>

    <p>
      We learned in an earlier lesson how to show the difference between our
      unstaged changes and the last commit. Like
      <span class="code--inline">git status</span>, this command doesn't change
      anything. It just reports back to you with some helpful information. Let's
      check it out now:
    </p>

    <p><code class="shell">git diff</code></p>

    <p>Read the output in your terminal.</p>

    <p>
      Notice that Git is showing you the deleted content from the "readme.txt"
      file, but the diff doesn't show anything about "demo.txt".
    </p>

    <p>
      That is because "demo.txt" is still "untracked" -- it's a new file that
      Git hasn't started tracking yet, so it can't tell you what's changed. It's
      all new, and there is no diff yet!
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chal-step blue-border border-box">
    <h3>Stage some changes but don't commit yet</h3>
    <p>
      What if we wanted to commit changes in some files but not others? We want
      to compose commits thoughtfully with related changes, so sometimes it
      makes sense to exclude some work and save it for a later commit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's stage the changes only from "demo.txt" and leave out the changes
      from "readme.txt". How would you do this?
    </p>

    <p>Here's what you will see if you do this step correctly:</p>

    <pre><code classname="code-block">
    On branch main
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
      new file:   <span class="code-green">demo.txt</span>

    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
      modified:   <span class="code-red">readme.txt</span>
  </code></pre>

    <p>
      Give it a go -- and if you need a reminder, look at earlier steps for
      guidance!
    </p>
  </div>
  <!-- check changes are committed for one file but not the other.  -->

  <div class="chal-verify red-border border-box">
    <p>
      Click the 'Verify' button to confirm that changes are staged for one file
      but not the other.
    </p>
  </div>

  {{{ verify_directory_button }}}

  <div class="chal-no-pass grey-border border-box">
    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
    <p>Here are some possible reasons you haven't passed this challenge.</p>

    <h4>You didn't stage the new file</h4>
    <p>To stage a file, you need to use this command:</p>
    <p><code class="shell">git add &#60;FILENAME&#62;</code></p>

    <h4>You staged readme.txt</h4>
    <p>
      We can unstage this file while leaving the changes as they are. To unstage
      a file, use this command:
    </p>
    <p><code class="shell">git reset &#60;FILENAME&#62;</code></p>

    <h4>You didn't make changes in both files</h4>
    <p>Open up your code editor and make the changes as instructed above.</p>

    <h4>You staged the file but the challenge still fails.</h4>
    <p>
      It's possible that your filename is incorrect. Check for whitespace and
      letters that should not be capitalized. For example, "Demo.txt" with a
      capital "D" is not the same as "demo.txt".
    </p>

    <h4>You committed your changes.</h4>
    <p>
      This challenge is only looking for staged changes. So, if you staged your
      changes and then went ahead and committed, the changes have moved from
      being staged to being committed, and so git doesn't find any changes in
      the "staging area". If this happens to you, just repeat the step above to
      make changes in "demo.txt", then stage the changes in that file, and click
      "Verify" again.
