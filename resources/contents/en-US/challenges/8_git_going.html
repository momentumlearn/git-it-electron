  <h2>GitHub Classroom</h2>
  <p>
    GitHub classroom is a tool that generates a repository on GitHub based on a
    code project assigned by your instructor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking on a project link from GitHub classroom will take you to a page
    that looks something like this:
  </p>

  <img
    src="../../../assets/imgs/gh-classroom-accept.png"
    alt="A screenshot from the page generated by GitHub classroom. It shows a message that says 'Accept this assignment?'. There is a green button that says 'Accept this assignment'."
    width="100%"
  />

  <p>
    Once you click the button to "Accept this assignment", GitHub will create a
    repo just for you, with your GitHub username in its title. When you see the
    "You're ready to go!" message, click on the link for your repo to be taken
    to your repo's main page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now you can work with this repo just like any other repo on GitHub. Let's
    walk through the steps that you will do at the start of every new project.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="chal-step blue-border border-box">
  <h3>Create the project repo</h3>

  <p>
    Usually your instructor will provide you with a link to each project. For
    this first walkthrough, use the button below.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking this button will take you to a page on GitHub like the one you saw
    in the previous section. On that page, accept the assignment, then read and
    follow the instructions you see there.
  </p>

  <button class="btn-secondary">
    <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/j2e7hrlB">Generate project repo</a>
  </button>

  <p>Once you have a repo on Github, continue to the next step.</p>
</div>

<div class="chal-step blue-border border-box">
  <h3>Clone the project repo</h3>

  <p>
    Click on the green button to "Clone or download" your repo. This will copy
    the repo's URL to your clipboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you intend to keep your
    projects. When you are in the directory you want to be in (check with
    <span class="code--inline">pwd</span>), type the following command, but in
    place of <span class="code--inline">url-for-your-repo</span>, paste in the
    URL you copied from GitHub.
  </p>

  <p><code class="shell">git clone url-for-your-repo</code></p>

  <p>
    You'll see output indicating the repo is being cloned. When it's done, make
    sure you <span class="code--inline">cd</span> into the repo.
  </p>

<div class="chal-step blue-border border-box">
  <h3>Make changes, add, commit, and push.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the project repo in VS Code.</li>
    <li>
      Make a change in the README file (add or delete something and save the
      file).
    </li>
    <li>Add changes: <code class="shell">git add README.md</code></li>
    <li>
      Commit changes:
      <code class="shell">git commit -m "Your message here"</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      Push changes to the main branch:
      <code class="shell">git push origin main</code>
