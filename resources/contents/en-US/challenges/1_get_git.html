  <h2>Git</h2>
  <p>
    Git is free <strong>open source software</strong> (the
    <a href="https://github.com/git/git">source code is public</a>) written by
    Linus Torvalds who also wrote the Linux operating system's kernel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Git is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in
    programming as <strong>version control</strong>. If you've used a "track
    changes" feature in a text editing software then you're already familiar
    with the concept!

  <h3>Confirm Git Configuration</h3>
  <p>
    In the computer set-up instructions, we asked you to install Git using
    Homebrew, and to configure your name, email, and a few default settings.
  </p>
  <p>In this step we'll check that configuration.</p>

  <p>
    Open your <strong>terminal</strong>. We're using iTerm2 as our terminal
    program at Momentum.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do this by using command-spacebar to open the Spotlight Search bar that
    is built into Mac OS, and type "iterm".
  </p>

  <p>You can verify that Git is available at your command line by typing:</p>

  <p><code class="shell">git --version</code></p>

  <p>
    This will return the version of Git on your computer and look something like
    this:
  </p>

  <p><code class="comment">git version 2.40.0</code></p>

  <p>
    The set-up instructions had you configure Git so it is able to associate
    your work to you. Check to see if it is configured properly:
  </p>

  <h4>Check to see if your name is configured in Git.</h4>
  <p>This command should print out your name:</p>
  <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.name</code></p>
  <p>If it's missing or incorrect, set it now with this command:</p>
  <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></p>

  <h4>Check to see if your email is configured in Git.</h4>
  <p>This command should print out your email:</p>
  <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.email</code></p>
  <p>If it's missing or incorrect, set it now with this command:</p>
  <p>
    <code class="shell"
      >git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"</code
    >
  </p>

  <h4>Check to see if your default branch is configured in Git.</h4>
  <p>
    This command should show that your default branch is set to
    <code class="code--inline">main</code>:
  </p>
  <p><code class="shell">git config --global init.defaultBranch</code></p>
  <p>If it's missing or incorrect, set it now with this command</p>
  <p><code class="shell">git config --global init.defaultBranch main</code></p>

  <h4>Check to see if a default merge strategy is configured in Git.</h4>
  <p>
    This command should show that the rebase merge strategy is set to
    <code class="code--inline">false</code>:
  </p>
  <p><code class="shell">git config --global pull.rebase</code></p>
  <p>If it's missing or incorrect, set it now with this command</p>
  <p><code class="shell">git config --global pull.rebase false</code></p>

  <p>
    Click the 'Verify' button to confirm that you have configured git with your
    username, email, default branch, and default merge strategy.

  <h3>Dollar Signs in Code Documentation</h3>
  <p>
    Dollar signs <code class="code--inline">$</code> are often used in
    programming documentation to signify that the line is
    <strong>command line</strong> code (see the code snippets above). You don't
    actually type the <code class="code--inline">$</code> in though; only type
    what comes after.
