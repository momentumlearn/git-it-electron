<h1>About Momentum Git-it</h1>
<p>
  Momentum Git-it is based on Git-it, originally built by
  <a href="https://jlord.us">@jlord</a> and contributors to teach the essential,
  everyday Git commands developers use everyday along with the GitHub Flow, the
  way developers collaborate on GitHub.
</p>

<p>
  This version adapts the original to the way Git and GitHub are used in
  Momentum's Software Engineering immersive course, including using GitHub
  Classroom to generate project repos for Momentum learners.
</p>

<p>
  Some challenges require an internet connection, so you'll need to be online to
  complete Git-it. But you can always open the app and view the challenges and
  resources offline.
</p>

<h4>Real Development Environment</h4>

<p>
  Git-it uses the real terminal, Git and GitHub (rather than emulating them).
  When you finish you'll have real repositories on your GitHub account and green
  squares on your contribution chart!
